# Knights of Musgueria Client

Based on [Tom Weiland's Networking Series] https://youtu.be/uh8XaC0Y5MA this small online multiplayer game was developed during quarantine as way to distract myself and my friends.

If you want to check the server's application code, you can check the following repo. [Knights Of Musgueria Server](https://github.com/IonelPopJara/Knights-Of-Musgueria-Server)

If you want to download the client and server versions, you can do it through the itch.io page.
